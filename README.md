# Solo BTC & Solo BCH Pool

## 🧱 About the Project

I’ve independently set up two solo mining pools — **Bitcoin** and **Bitcoin Cash**.

The pools are running on **local Stratum servers** based on **Ubuntu + Docker**, with full `bitcoind` nodes, a custom **web interface**, and a **Telegram bot** for real-time monitoring (SPS, best share, connected workers, etc).

## 🎯 Block Found

✅ I successfully found a block on my **Bitcoin Cash solo pool**:  
**Block #902906**  
You can verify it in any BCH block explorer and see my signature in the **coinbase transaction**.

I’m looking for an experienced **solo pool operator or enthusiast** who can:

- Audit and review my current BTC & BCH pool setups
